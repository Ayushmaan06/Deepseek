# Build DeepSeek from Scratch - Phase 1: Attention Mechanism

**By: Ayushmaan Singh**

## Overview
This lecture explores the need for attention mechanisms in language models and introduces the concept of self-attention. Understanding attention is crucial before diving into DeepSeek's Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) innovation.

## Historical Context of Attention

### Evolution Timeline
1. **1966**: ELIZA chatbot - First NLP chatbot (therapist simulation)
2. **1980s**: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) - Introduced memory capability
3. **1997**: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) - Enhanced memory for longer sequences
4. **2014**: Bahdanau Attention - First attention mechanism (with RNNs)
5. **2017**: "Attention is All You Need" - Transformer architecture (removed RNNs)
6. **2018**: GPT architecture - Decoder-only transformers with self-attention

### The Memory Problem in Neural Networks
**Core Issue**: Traditional neural networks cannot handle memory/context
- **Context Definition**: Understanding what came earlier in a paragraph to make predictions
- **Example**: "I am from Pune, India... What language do I speak?"
  - Need to remember location information from beginning of text
  - Immediate surrounding words are insufficient

## RNN/LSTM Limitations

### Sequence-to-Sequence Translation Example
**Architecture**: Encoder-Decoder with Hidden States
```
Input:  "I will eat"
Output: "Je mangerai"
```

**RNN Processing**:
- **Encoder**: h₁ → h₂ → h₃ (accumulates memory)
- **Context Transfer**: Only final hidden state h₃ passed to decoder
- **Decoder**: Uses h₃ to generate output sequence

### Context Bottleneck Problem
**Key Issue**: All context compressed into single vector (final hidden state)

**Real-world Analogy**: 
- Read entire paragraph
- Close eyes and translate from memory
- Impossible because you can't remember every detail

**Technical Problem**:
- Huge paragraph → Single 500/1000-dimensional vector
- Information loss inevitable
- Decoder only receives final hidden state
- No access to earlier context

**Solution Needed**: Access to ALL encoder hidden states during decoding

## Introduction to Attention Mechanism

### Core Concept: Selective Access
**Fundamental Principle**: "Selectively access parts of the input sequence during decoding"

**Human Translation Process**:
1. Focus on small context window (5-10 words)
2. Mask out irrelevant parts
3. Pay maximum attention to relevant tokens
4. Move attention window progressively

**Mathematical Representation**:
- α₂₁ = attention from token 2 to token 1
- α₂₂ = attention from token 2 to token 2
- α₂₃ = attention from token 2 to token 3

### Bahdanau Attention (2014)
**First Implementation**: Attention mechanism with RNN architecture
- **Innovation**: Decoder can attend to ALL encoder hidden states
- **Visualization**: Attention heatmaps showing word alignments
- **Discovery**: Non-diagonal attention patterns (word order differences between languages)

**Example**: English "European Economic Area" → French "Économique Européenne Zone"
- Attention learns cross-linguistic word positioning
- Bright spots show strongest attention connections

### Transformer Revolution (2017)
**Key Insight**: RNNs not necessary for attention mechanism
- **2014**: Attention + RNN
- **2017**: Attention + Transformer (RNN removed)
- **Architecture**: Pure attention-based processing

## Self-Attention for Next Token Prediction

### Definition
**Self-Attention**: Mechanism allowing every position in input sequence to attend to ALL positions in the SAME sequence

### Distinction from Cross-Attention
- **Cross-Attention**: Between different sequences (translation: English → French)
- **Self-Attention**: Within same sequence (next token prediction)

### Why Self-Attention is Crucial

**Context Understanding Example**:
```
Input: "I am from Pune, India. I speak..."
```
- Token "speak" needs maximum attention to "Pune" and "India"
- Regional information determines language prediction
- Other words less relevant for this prediction

**Core Purpose**: Learn relationships between tokens within same sequence

## Technical Implementation

### Input to Context Vector Transformation

**Input Embedding Vector**:
- Contains: Token embedding + Positional embedding
- Dimension: 768 (GPT-2 example)
- Information: Word meaning + position, NO neighbor information

**Context Vector**:
- Enhanced representation including neighbor information
- Result of attention mechanism
- Dimension: Same as input (768)
- Information: Word meaning + position + neighbor relationships

**Transformation Goal**: 
```
Input Embedding → [Attention Mechanism] → Context Vector
```

### Mathematical Framework

**Example Sentence**: "The next day is bright"
- Tokens as vectors: X₁, X₂, X₃, X₄, X₅
- Query token: X₂ ("next")
- Attention scores: α₂₁, α₂₂, α₂₃, α₂₄, α₂₅

**Context Vector Calculation**:
```
Context₂ = α₂₁·X₁ + α₂₂·X₂ + α₂₃·X₃ + α₂₄·X₄ + α₂₅·X₅
```

## Attention Score Computation Challenge

### Naive Approach: Dot Product
**Method**: Simple dot product between vectors
```
α₂₁ = X₂ · X₁  (dot product)
```

**Problem Example**: "The dog chased the ball but it couldn't catch it"
- Query: "it" (second occurrence)
- Key candidates: "dog", "ball"
- Dot products: it·dog = 0.51, it·ball = 0.51
- **Issue**: Identical scores, but "it" should refer to "ball"

### Why Dot Product Fails
**Limitation**: Only measures semantic similarity
- Cannot capture contextual relationships
- Misses linguistic nuances
- Example: "catch" more likely refers to moving object (ball) not agent (dog)

## Solution: Learnable Transformations

### Query-Key-Value Framework
**Innovation**: Replace dot product with learnable matrices

**Matrices Introduced**:
- **WQ**: Query weight matrix
- **WK**: Key weight matrix  
- **WV**: Value weight matrix (covered in next lecture)

**Transformation Process**:
```
Query = Input_embedding × WQ
Key = Input_embedding × WK
Attention_score = Query · Key
```

**Advantage**: Multiple trainable parameters to capture complex relationships

### Example with Matrices
**Before transformation**:
- it·dog = 0.51
- it·ball = 0.51

**After learnable transformation**:
- Query(it) · Key(dog) = 0.56
- Query(it) · Key(ball) = 0.96

**Result**: Attention correctly identifies "ball" as primary reference

## Deep Learning Philosophy

### Parameter vs. Rule-Based Approach
**Physics Approach**: Spend months deriving mathematical laws
**Deep Learning Approach**: 
1. Can't determine exact relationship
2. Introduce trainable parameters
3. Let backpropagation discover relationships
4. Initialize randomly, train through gradient descent

**Historical Pattern**: Same approach used in:
- CNNs for image recognition (vs. hand-crafted features)
- Attention mechanisms (vs. fixed attention rules)

## Key Terminology

### Query, Key, Value Explanation
**Not based on deep theory**: Practical necessity
- **Query**: Token we're focusing on
- **Key**: All tokens being compared against
- **Value**: Information to be aggregated (next lecture)

**Naming**: Borrowed from information retrieval systems
